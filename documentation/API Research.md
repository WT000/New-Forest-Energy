# Research into APIs for interacting with Smart Meters

When creating an API for monitoring smart meters, there are aspects that must be taken into consideration. The Hildebrand Glowmarket API is free of cost which requires verification for an account and to download an app for the client to have access to the smart meter data. As this API can be used with most brands of smart meters, it is convenient as it can be used if the client already has their own smart meter. Although the only additional cost is if the client requires the data to be monitored in real time which would need a Hildebrand smart meter device which adds to the cost. Authentication for the client needs to be renewed every 48 hours which may be inefficient for the client.

Developing our own API we would need to have every reading stored for that specific date. The API also needs integration for both gas and electric readings and then calculations of the average cost of that day, month or year. The client would have the choice of being able to export this data into a format such as JSON. Two different variations of accounts for the API would be needed, one for the homeowner which can only see meter data from their own home and an account for the client which can see every homeowner's data. A difficulty when developing our own API would be the actual collection of the reading data from the smart meter as it would be something we are unable to test.
